            Advanced REST Client accesses data stored in your Google Drive on your request only and limits the information to created by the application files and folders only.
            Authorization tokens are stored in memory and are cleared when you close the application.<br/>
            ARC uses Google Drive to list created by the application files when using "Open from Drive" option. It uploads requests, projects, or backup data to Your Drive
            when you request it in application UI.<br/>
            The application do not use Google Drive for anything else. The application do not store Google profile information.

          <p>Protecting your data and your trust is always our first priority. The application never shares <b>any</b> data until you request or allow it.</p>
          <p>
            To provide better quality the app is collecting anonymous usage statistics.
          </p>
          <p>Data the app is using and how:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Any access tokens provided by you or generated by the app are stored in local history along with the request.</li>
            <li>Google Drive file ID of opened by the app file is stored in the local history.</li>
            <li>(Chrome app only) You settings are synced between your profiles, if you are signed in to Chrome, using Google Sync service for Chrome Apps.</li>
            <li>The app collects critical errors generated by the app and send them to Google Analytics. Data included in the report contains information about the exception itself (error message) and intentionally will not collect any user or user provided data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can turn off Google Analytics and local history in application settings.
